# Project Title
A Personalised Diabetes Mellitus Risk 
Assessment Tool using Machine Learning and 
Explainable AI.

## Abstract
Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. It is a 
serious metabolic illness that has a negative impact on the body. Early diagnosis and risk 
assessment has been shown to have a huge impact on the management and development 
of diabetes mellitus. Risk factors like family history, prediabetic, age, weight and sedentary 
lifestyle are indicators of diabetes mellitus. So, by making changes to your diet and by taking 
up more physical activity it has been shown to have led to better outcomes and 
substantially reduced the risk of diabetes. Machine learning models has been used for 
diabetes risk assessment, but their decision-making process can be difficult to explain. This 
where explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) comes in, providing transparency and 
understanding of the decision-making process of the machine learning models.
In this dissertation, we developed a personalised diabetes risk assessment tool using a 
machine learning model trained from a dataset that has some physiological data (insulin and 
glucose levels), demographic data (age) and body mass index. Explainable AI models (Lime 
and SHAP) were used to explain the modelâ€™s decision-making process. The results show that 
the risk assessment tool has a relatively high accuracy and can provide useful insights into 
the factors and what magnitude they contribute to diabetes risk. Overall, this dissertation 
demonstrates the potential of explainable AI to improving transparency and interpretability 
of machine learning model predictions which in turn improve trust in Machine learning 
tools.
